/**
 * GstImxVpuDecoder:
 *
 * Video decoding element based on the i.MX VPU.
 *
 * Internally, the decoder uses an imxvpuapi ImxVpuDecoder instance
 * to perform the actual decoding.
 *
 * GStreamer buffer pools and the VPU's own buffer pool mechanism are at
 * odds with each other, because both pick a buffer on their own, and
 * usually, their picks do not match. Since it is not possible to disable
 * the VPU pool, a trick is used.
 * The decoder uses a "decoder context", which represents a state where
 * a set of DMA-allocated framebuffers are registered with the VPU. This
 * creates the VPU pool; the VPU will later automatically pick one of
 * the framebuffers in this pool which are marked as "free". This context
 * is created whenever a new video format is set via @set_caps. Later,
 * during decoding, when an output gstbuffer is requested from the
 * GstVideoDecoder base class, this will cause a new GStreamer buffer pool
 * to be created in the @decide_allocation function. In this function,
 * a decoder_framebuffer_pool is created, and it is associated with the
 * current decoder context. This pool returns "empty" buffers, that is,
 * buffers which contain only GstMeta blocks, no GstMemory ones. After
 * getting the buffer, the decoder manually adds a GstMemory block to
 * this buffer with @gst_imx_vpu_framebuffer_array_set_framebuffer_in_gstbuffer.
 * As a result, the buffer contains the newly decoded imxvpu framebuffer
 * that the VPU just emitted. This makes sure the output gstbuffers conform
 * to the output of the VPU. It essentially circumvents the GstBufferPool
 * logic, but this necessary in this case.
 *
 * The decoder also keeps track of unfinished GstVideoCodecFrame instances
 * via the unfinished_frames_table. When the decoder is stopped, any
 * remaining unfinished frames will be released, avoiding memory leaks.
