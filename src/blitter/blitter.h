/**
 * GstImxBlitterClass:
 *
 * The blitter base class implements operations common for various blitters
 * in the i.MX SoC. It handles fallbacks for input buffers that are not
 * physically contiguous, provides functions for creating buffer pools for
 * physically contiguous memory, and offers a high-level interface for
 * blit operations. Derived classes are informed about what the input and
 * output buffers are (both guaranteed to be physically contiguous), what
 * the input video info and the output region is, and then told to blit.
 * 90-degree step rotation is also handled by the base class.
 *
 * The blitters get as input a buffer containing a frame in physically
 * contiguous memory, and a region describing what subset of that frame is
 * to be blitted. The output consists of a physically contiguous frame and
 * a canvas with precalculated empty regions, inner region, and visibility
 * mask. Rotation is automatically handled during those internal calculations,
 * so the derived class does not have to care about computing any of these
 * regions. It can focus on the blitting itself.
 *
 * The derived class is expected to ref the input frame at least until a new
 * one is set via @gst_imx_blitter_set_input_frame. Same applies to output frames.
 * Derived classes are free to keep frames ref'd for as long as they need.
 * In practice, derived classes unref the old frame as soon as a new frame is passed,
 * and at most hold on to the old frame for deinterlacing purposes.
 * @blit may be called multiple times before the next frame is set, so the derived
 * class must ensure that the frames stay valid until the next ones are set, as
 * described above. This is for example used when the frame needs to be redrawn
 * while the pipeline is in PAUSED state.
 *
 * Derived classes must unref all frames though when @flush is called, and when
 * it shuts down. Furthermore, it is not recommended to keep a hold on frames unless
 * strictly necessary, since this wastes resources, and can in extreme cases lead to
 * deadlocks (if the buffers come from a fixed bufferpool which allows no additional
 * allocations on the fly).
 *
 *
 * @parent_class:           The parent class structure
 * @set_input_video_info:   Optional.
 *                          Called when @gst_imx_blitter_set_input_video_info is called.
 *                          This gives derived blitters the chance to update any internal state
 *                          related to the video info.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @set_output_video_info:  Optional.
 *                          Called when @gst_imx_blitter_set_output_video_info is called.
 *                          This gives derived blitters the chance to update any internal state
 *                          related to the video info.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @set_input_region:       Optional.
 *                          Defines what subset of the input frame shall be blitted.
 *                          A NULL region means the entire input frame shall be blitted.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @set_output_canvas:      Optional.
 *                          Defines where on the output frame the input pixels shall be blitted to.
 *                          The canvas must have valid visibility mask and (clipped) regions.
 *                          Use @gst_imx_canvas_calculate_inner_region and @gst_imx_canvas_clip
 *                          for this purpose.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @set_num_output_pages:   Optional.
 *                          If a blitter clears the empty regions only once, this information is useful,
 *                          since a num_output_pages larger than 1 means the caller will instruct the
 *                          blitter to blit to multiple output pages as part of a page flipping process.
 *                          The blitter therefore has to clear the empty regions once for each page.
 *                          Blitters which update the empty regions every time can ignore this.
 *                          A page count of 0 is invalid.
 *                          If this is not called, or if this vfunc is not defined, then the blitter
 *                          behaves as if the vfunc was called with a page count of 1.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @set_input_frame:        Required.
 *                          Sets the blitter's input frame. This may or may not be the frame set by
 *                          @gst_imx_blitter_set_input_frame . It depends on whether or not the
 *                          input buffer passed to this function is physically contiguous or not.
 *                          If it isn't, an internal copy is made to a DMA buffer, and that buffer
 *                          is passed on to this function, as the "input_frame" parameter.
 *                          This function must ref the frame and store it internally until the
 *                          blitter is flushed, shut down, or a new frame is set. (In the latter
 *                          case, it can hold on to the old frame even if a new frame is supplied;
 *                          this is useful for deinterlacing, for example.)
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @set_output_frame:       Required.
 *                          Sets the blitter's output frame. This function works just like
 *                          @set_input_frame, except that the output frame *must* be a physically
 *                          contiguous buffer (it does not do any internal copies, unlike
 *                          @set_input_frame).
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @get_phys_mem_allocator: Required.
 *                          Returns a GstAllocator which allocates physically contiguous memory.
 *                          Which allocator to use is up to the derived blitter.
 *                          The blitter base class unrefs the returned allocator when it is no
 *                          longer needed.
 *                          If something went wrong, it returns NULL.
 * @fill_region:            Required.
 *                          The color is specified in this format: 0xBBGGRR (the MSB are not used).
 *                          The region must be fully within the output frame.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @blit:                   Required.
 *                          Performs the actual blit operation.
 *                          Derived classes should consider calling this an error if the input and
 *                          output frames weren't both set before.
 *                          This call can be repeated multiple times, each one resulting in the same
 *                          blit operation. The output is not guaranteed to look the same though,
 *                          unless alpha is 255.
 *                          alpha is an alpha blending factor. 0 means completely translucent, 255
 *                          completely opaque.
 *                          Returns TRUE if it successfully completed, FALSE otherwise.
 * @flush:                  Optional.
 *                          Flushes any internal cached or temporary states, buffers, ref'd frames etc.
 *                          This may be called repeatedly. If there is nothing to flush, this function
 *                          should do nothing. In particular, it is called when the blitter's dispose
 *                          function is invoked.
